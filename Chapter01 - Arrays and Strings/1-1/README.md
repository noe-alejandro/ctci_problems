# <strong>1.1 Unique:</strong>
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Answers:
<strong>1-1_greedy.cpp</strong> will solve most character encodings and produce an O(n^2) time complexity.<br />
<strong>1-1_optimize.cpp</strong> will solve ASCII encodings and produce an O(n) time complexity.<br />
